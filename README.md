# MemeBuilder(ai)

## 🧠 Overview

**MemeBuilder(ai)** is a modular, no-code token launch framework for DAOs on **Solana**.  
It empowers communities to **propose, vote on, fund, and launch memecoins** in a fully automated, trustless, and decentralized manner – directly on-chain.

The platform integrates optional third-party modules including:
- Personalized **AI agents**
- **KOL** (Key Opinion Leader) campaign orchestration
- **InfoFi** analytics for smart launch strategies

Our mission: **replace fragmented token launch processes** with a scalable system that aligns incentives, ensures transparency, and leverages smart contract automation.
